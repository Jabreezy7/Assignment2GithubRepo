# Assignment 2 Write Up by Mohammed Baled

## Plan of Attack
I would say that the bulk of this assignment had to do with the actual creation of the DLB trie via the add(string) and add() methods.

## Data Structures Used 
To create the DLB Trie I used linked lists of linked lists where each node had a pointer to their child, parent, previous sibling, and next sibling. In addition, each node contained the following attributes: a data attribute that took in a char, a size attribute that took an int that corresponded to the amount of words that start with that node, and a isWord attribute that indicated if that node marked the end of a word in our trie.

## General Algorithim Procedure for add(String word)/add() methods

The actual algorithims are pretty much identical apart from the following differences:
1. The add() method did not check for dupes because we would not be allowed to even add a currentPrefix if it already existed in our trie
2. The add() method set the CurrentNode.isWord value equal to true as our currentPrefix is a word in the trie

Main Procedure:

My algorithim iterated across all the letters in our input string and for each letter we would iterate across the trie starting from the root. In order to iterate through the trie I created a temp node called curr and initialized it to point to the root. We would first check to see if curr's data was equal to our letter and if it was we would simply increment the size for the node at curr and proceed to the check the next letter, but if our curr's data was not equal we would traverse that curr's sibling list to find a node that contained data equal to our letter. If no such letter existed then we would attach our own sibling node and continue.

Other important implemntations to note:

1. If we were on the last iteration of the input string (last letter) we have to set the isWord attribute of the new node created to true
2. If we were on the last letter and we find a node that has data equal to our letter and that node has a isWord value of true then we must decrement the size of each node that we incremented before when going down the trie and return false because that means we were attempting to add a dupe into our trie. (This only applies to the "add(String word)" method)


Algorithim Runtime:

In the worst case we would be iterating across the entire sibling list, which at most could be equal to the alphabet size, for each letter in our word. 

Runtime: O(alphabet size * word.length()).


## General Algorithim Procedure for advance(char c) method:

Main Procedure: 

My algorithim first appended the letter c into our currentPrefix string and then would check our currentNodes.child sibling list to see if any nodes contained the letter that we are trying to add. We iterated across the sibling list by creating a temp node called curr. If a node did contain that letter then we would set our currentNode to point to our temp curr node and then return true. If a node did not contain that letter then we would increment "trailCounter" -  an int variable that kept track of how many times we have attempted to append to a word that doesn't exist in our trie - and return false.

Algorithim Runtime: 

Since we only traversed the currentNode.childs sibling list we could in the worst case be traversing the entire sibling list which at max could be the size of the alphabet. 

Runtime: O(alphabet size).

## General Algorithim Procedure for retreat() method:

Main Procedure:

My algorithim proceeded by checking if our currentPrefix was empty. If it was then we would throw an IllegalStateException. Otherwise it would then check if our trailCounter was not equal to 0. If it wasn't equal to 0 then that means our currentPrefix is not a word/prefix in the trie, so we can just delete the last character of the string and decrement our trailCounter variable. If our trailCounter was equal to 0 then that means our currentPrefix is a word/prefix in the string so we must delete the last character of our currentPrefix string and set our currentNode to equal its parent. 


Algorithim Runtime:

We are simply removing the last character in our Stringbuilder and possibly setting the currentNode to equal its parent. 

Runtime: O(1)


## General Algorithim Procedure for reset() method:

We are simply setting emptying the currentPrefix by setting its length to 0. We are setting currentNode equal to null. We are also resetting the trailCounter to 0.

Algorithim Runtime: 

O(1)

## General Algorithim Procedure for isWord() method:

If our trailCounter variable is not equal to 0 then that means our currentPrefix is not in the trie so we can simply return false. Otherwise we would just return the isWord value of the currentNode.

Algorithim Runtime: 

O(1)

## General Algorithim Procedure for getNumberOfPredictions() method:

If our trailCounter is not equal to 0 then that means our currentPrefix is not a word or a prefix so we can simply return 0. Otherwise we can just return the size value of the currentNode.

Algorithim Runtime: 

O(1)

## General Algorithim Procedure for retrievePrediction() method:

Main procedure: 

If our trail counter is not equal to 0 then that means our currentPrefix is not a word or a prefix so we return null because we can not make a prediction. 

Otherwise we would create a new Stringbuilder object called predictionString and append our currentPrefix to it. If our currentPrefix is already a word in the trie then we would simply return our currentPrefix. Otherwise we would iterate across the child list of our currentNode. We do this by first creating a temp node called curr. We would iterate across the entire child list rooted at currentNode and append each node's data to our predictionString until we found a node that had a isWord value of true. Then we would return our predictionString.

Algorithim Runtime:

The runtime for this method is simply equal to the amount of times we appended a word to our predictionString. 

Runtime: O(predictionString.length()-currentPrefix.length()) or O(predictionString.length())


## Coding/Debugging Issues I Ran Into
I ran into a problem in which my currentNode was not synced with the last letter of my curerntPrefix and to take care of this I created trailCounter that kept track of the difference in the currentNode and currentPrefix.
